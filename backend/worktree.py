"""
Git Worktree Isolation

Each agent session gets its own git worktree so it can't break the main codebase.
After the session, the worktree can be merged (if successful) or discarded.

Structure:
  project_root/
    .devfleet-worktrees/
      session-{id}/   (worktree checkout on branch devfleet/{id})
